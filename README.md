# Serverless AWS Infrastructure Monitoring ðŸš€

A **serverless, cost-effective solution** to monitor AWS infrastructure â€” starting with **EC2 instances** â€” and take automated actions to save costs.  
This repository contains a **Python script** and **Terraform modules** that together provide monitoring, alerting, and automated remediation.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Many teams rely on paid SaaS monitoring tools like Datadog or New Relic. While powerful, they can be expensive for smaller projects.  
This solution leverages **AWS Lambda, CloudWatch Events, and SNS** to build a lightweight, scalable, and cost-efficient monitoring system â€” **without running any servers.**

### âœ¨ Features
- âœ… Monitors EC2 instances running beyond a configurable runtime (default: 24h)
- âœ… Automatically **stops** or **terminates** instances
- âœ… Sends alerts via **Amazon SNS** (email/SMS/integrations)
- âœ… Fully **serverless** & pay-per-use
- âœ… Easily **extendable** to EBS, Snapshots, RDS, or other resources
- âœ… **Infrastructure-as-Code** with Terraform

**Components:**
1. **Python Script** â€“ Identifies long-running EC2 instances and stops/terminates them.
2. **AWS Lambda** â€“ Hosts and runs the script serverlessly.
3. **CloudWatch Events** â€“ Triggers the Lambda function on a schedule.
4. **Amazon SNS** â€“ Sends alerts with details of stopped/terminated instances.
